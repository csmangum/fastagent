# FastAgent
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development%20â€“%20Experimental%20%26%20Aspirational-blue)

FastAgent is a high-performance framework for real-time voice bots that delivers seamless, low-latency interactions. Built with FastAPI, it integrates the AudioCodes VoiceAI Connect API for voice input and the OpenAI Realtime API for dialogue and voice generation. FastAgent combines a dynamic, Stateful LLM Layer conversational core with finite state machine (FSM) agents for complex tasks, ensuring rapid, context-aware voice interactions optimized for enterprise applications.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Dialogue**: OpenAI's AI drives fluid, multi-turn conversations without rigid states
- **Structured Tasks**: FSM agents ensure reliable, step-by-step task handling
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: FastAPI-powered audio passthrough and real-time processing
- **Call Continuity**: Automatic handling of disconnections with context preservation
- **Modular Design**: Easily add new FSM-based tasks (e.g., payments, queries)
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Track agent decision-making processes through AFSM architecture

## Architecture

FastAgent employs a hybrid architecture:

- **Stateful LLM Layer**: Leverages OpenAI's stateful context for natural language understanding and conversation flow
- **AFSM Task Agents**: When triggered by specific intents, dedicated Agentic Finite State Machines handle structured workflows
- **Concurrent Execution**: Conversation flows uninterrupted while FSM agents handle tasks in parallel
