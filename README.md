# FastAgent
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development%20â€“%20Experimental%20%26%20Aspirational-blue)

FastAgent is a high-performance framework designed to integrate telephony systems with intelligent, real-time voice agents. It leverages FastAPI for HTTP/WebSocket communication and introduces the concept of Agentic Finite State Machines (AFSM) to provide structured, controllable, and dynamic conversational flows.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Optimized for real-time voice interactions
- **State-Aware Conversations**: AFSM architecture maintains context throughout interactions
- **Telephony Integration**: Seamless connection with SIP, WebRTC, and other voice systems
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend with custom states and transitions
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Optional logging of agent decision-making processes
