![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development%20â€“%20Experimental%20%26%20Aspirational-blue)

OpusAgent is a powerful, enterprise-grade conversational AI platform that combines the natural language understanding of GPT-4o with a robust Finite State Agent (FSA) framework. It enables the creation of rational voice and chat agents that can handle complex, multi-step workflows while maintaining natural conversation flow. The platform is particularly well-suited for customer support, banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications where reliable, auditable, and context-aware interactions are crucial.

At its core, OpusAgent bridges the gap between natural language processing and deterministic task execution. It leverages GPT-4o's advanced language understanding capabilities while maintaining strict control over business logic through its FSA framework. This unique combination allows for:

- **Natural Conversations**: The system maintains fluid, context-aware dialogues that feel natural to users
- **Deterministic Execution**: Every action and state transition is controlled and auditable
- **Complex Workflow Support**: Handles multi-step processes like account management, payment processing, and service requests
- **Real-time Processing**: Ultra-low latency audio processing for voice interactions
- **Enterprise Integration**: Seamless connection with existing business systems and APIs
- **Compliance & Security**: Built-in support for audit trails and secure data handling

The platform's architecture is designed to scale from simple Q&A bots to complex, multi-domain enterprise assistants, making it ideal for organizations that need both conversational flexibility and process reliability.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Dialogue**: OpenAI's AI drives fluid, multi-turn conversations without rigid states.
- **Structured Tasks**: FSA agents ensure reliable, step-by-step task handling.
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: FastAPI-powered audio passthrough and real-time processing.
- **Call Continuity**: Automatic handling of disconnections with context preservation.
- **Modular Design**: Easily add new FSA-based tasks (e.g., payments, queries).
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Track agent decision-making processes through FSA architecture.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Orchestrates tool/function calls, manages conversational context, and ensures reliable, auditable execution between the LLM and backend services.

## Architecture

OpusAgent's architecture combines three key layers:

- **Conversation Layer**: Powered by GPT-4o, handles natural language understanding and dialogue management
- **Control Layer**: FSA framework manages state transitions and workflow execution
- **Integration Layer**: MCP connects the conversation and control layers with backend services

This layered approach enables natural conversations while maintaining strict control over business logic and ensuring reliable execution of complex workflows.
