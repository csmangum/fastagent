# Card Replacement Function Handlers

## Overview

This document describes the function handlers implemented for the card replacement flow in the FastAgent system. These handlers integrate with the finite state rational agents to drive a structured card replacement conversation flow.

## Architecture

Each function handler:
- Imports the corresponding prompt from `rc_prompts.py`
- Formats the prompt with contextual data
- Returns structured guidance for the AI and state management data
- Drives the progression through the card replacement finite state machine

## Function Handlers

## State Flow

The card replacement flow follows this sequence:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[call_intent: card_replacement] --> B[member_account_confirmation]
    B --> C[replacement_reason]
    C --> D[confirm_address]
    D --> E[start_card_replacement]
    E --> F[finish_card_replacement]
    F --> G[wrap_up]
    G --> H[End Call]
```

## Integration with Finite State Machine

Each function handler returns context data that can be used by finite state rational agents:

- **`stage`**: Current position in the replacement flow
- **`next_action`**: What the system should do next
- **`context`**: Preserved state information for continuity

## Example Usage Flow

1. **Intent Detection**
   ```
   User: "I need to replace my card"
   â†’ call_intent(intent="card_replacement")
   ```

2. **Account Confirmation**
   ```
   â†’ member_account_confirmation(member_accounts=["Gold card", "Silver card"])
   AI: "Which card do you want to replace - Gold card or Silver card?"
   ```

3. **Reason Collection**
   ```
   User: "My Gold card"
   â†’ replacement_reason(card_in_context="Gold card")
   AI: "What's the reason for replacing your Gold card?"
   ```

4. **Address Confirmation**
   ```
   User: "I lost it"
   â†’ confirm_address(card_in_context="Gold card", address_on_file="...")
   AI: "We'll send the new card to [address]. Is this correct?"
   ```

5. **Process Start**
   ```
   User: "Yes, that's correct"
   â†’ start_card_replacement(card_in_context="Gold card", address_in_context="...")
   AI: "Starting the replacement process for your Gold card..."
   ```

6. **Process Completion**
   ```
   â†’ finish_card_replacement(card_in_context="Gold card", address_in_context="...")
   AI: "Your new Gold card will arrive in 5-7 business days..."
   ```

7. **Call Wrap-up**
   ```
   â†’ wrap_up(organization_name="Bank of Peril")
   AI: "Thank you for calling Bank of Peril. Have a great day!"
   ```

## OpenAI Function Tool Definitions

The handlers are registered as OpenAI function tools in the session configuration:

```python
tools=[
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "member_account_confirmation",
        "description": "Confirm which member account/card needs replacement.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "member_accounts": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {"type": "string"},
                    "description": "List of available member accounts/cards"
                },
                "organization_name": {"type": "string"}
            }
        },
    },
    # ... other tools
]
```

## Benefits

- **Modular Design**: Each step is handled by a dedicated function
- **Prompt Separation**: Business logic separated from prompt templates
- **State Management**: Rich context data for finite state machines
- **Testability**: Each handler can be tested independently
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify prompts without changing function logic
- **Extensibility**: New steps can be added easily

## Example Conversation with Under-the-Hood Context

**AI Response**: "Thank you for calling Bank of Peril. Have a great day!"

---

### **State Flow Summary**

The conversation progressed through these finite states:

1. **`intent_detected`** â†’ User expresses card replacement need
2. **`account_confirmation`** â†’ System confirms which card to replace
3. **`reason_collection`** â†’ System collects replacement reason
4. **`address_confirmation`** â†’ System verifies delivery address
5. **`replacement_started`** â†’ Process initiation
6. **`replacement_complete`** â†’ Process completion with delivery info
7. **`call_complete`** â†’ Conversation termination

### **Context Preservation**

Throughout the conversation, the system maintained and enriched context:
- **Initial**: Intent and available options
- **Progressive**: Selected card, reason, address details
- **Complete**: Full transaction history for potential follow-up

This context enables the finite state machine to make intelligent transitions and provide personalized responses at each step.
