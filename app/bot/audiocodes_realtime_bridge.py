"""
Bridge module for connecting AudioCodes WebSocket protocol with OpenAI Realtime API.

This module provides a robust integration between AudioCodes VoiceAI Connect platform
and OpenAI's Realtime API, enabling real-time speech-to-speech conversations.

Key Design Decisions:
1. Singleton Pattern: We use a singleton instance to ensure global state management
   and prevent multiple bridge instances from conflicting.
2. Async-First: The entire module is built around async/await patterns for optimal
   performance in handling real-time audio streams.
3. Memory Management: We implement careful cleanup of resources to prevent memory leaks
   in long-running applications.
4. Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging for production
   debugging.

Performance Considerations:
- Audio chunk processing is optimized for low latency
- Base64 encoding/decoding is done efficiently
- Connection state is carefully managed to prevent resource leaks
- Memory usage is monitored and controlled

Security Notes:
- API keys are managed through environment variables
- WebSocket connections are authenticated
- Audio data is handled securely in memory

    Bridge between AudioCodes WebSocket protocol and OpenAI Realtime API.
    
    This class implements a sophisticated bridge that handles:
    1. Real-time audio streaming between AudioCodes and OpenAI
    2. Connection state management and recovery
    3. Performance monitoring and optimization
    4. Resource cleanup and memory management
    
    The implementation follows these principles:
    - Zero-copy where possible
    - Minimal memory allocation
    - Efficient error handling
    - Comprehensive logging
    
    Thread Safety:
    - This class is designed to be thread-safe
    - All operations are asynchronous
    - State modifications are atomic
    
    Memory Management:
    - Resources are carefully tracked and cleaned up
    - Large objects are released immediately after use
    - Circular references are avoided
