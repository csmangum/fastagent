**OpusAgent: A Low-Latency FastAPI Bridge for Real-Time Telephony Voice Agents Using Finite State Agents (FSA)**

---

## Abstract

OpusAgent is a high-performance, low-latency framework designed to integrate telephony systems with intelligent, real-time voice agents. It leverages FastAPI for HTTP/WebSocket communication and introduces the concept of Finite State Agents (FSA) to provide structured, controllable, and dynamic conversational flows. OpusAgent enables stateful, memory-aware voice interactions that are modular, scalable, and optimized for live customer engagements.

## Introduction

The need for responsive, intelligent voice systems is rising rapidly across industries such as banking, healthcare, and customer service. Traditional IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems are rigid, slow, and often frustrating to users. Conversely, purely generative AI systems often lack necessary control, leading to unpredictable or unsafe behavior.

OpusAgent bridges these two paradigms by combining:
- FastAPI's high concurrency and low-latency performance.
- Telephony integration for real-time voice streaming.
- Finite State Agents (FSA) for structure, context-awareness, and reliability.

This architecture provides enterprises and developers with a powerful platform to deploy flexible, safe, and efficient voice-based agents.

## Key Concepts

### FastAPI Bridge
OpusAgent uses FastAPI as its core web framework to:
- Handle real-time WebSocket and HTTP traffic.
- Interface directly with telephony platforms (e.g., SIP, WebRTC, Voice AI Connect).
- Manage sessions, context, and state with millisecond latency.

### Telephony Integration
OpusAgent supports:
- Audio streaming via WebSocket.
- DTMF tone recognition.
- Session lifecycle management (start, maintain, terminate calls).
- Optional audio recording and playback capabilities.

### Finite State Agents (FSA)
FSA extends traditional FSMs by:
- Embedding agent reasoning into each state.
- Utilizing scratchpads for localized reasoning.
- Dynamically adjusting the next state based on LLM-influenced or rule-based outputs.

Each agent instance maintains:
- **Current State**
- **Salient Context** (important facts, past conversation, user status)
- **Scratchpad** (temporary reasoning space for real-time decision making)
- **Memory History** (persisted session memory if required)

## System Architecture

1. **Telephony Gateway**
   - Incoming call triggers a FastAPI WebSocket session.
   - Audio streams to and from the voice agent.

2. **Session Manager**
   - Initializes a new FSA agent per call.
   - Stores and updates session context.

3. **FSA Engine**
   - Each user utterance triggers state evaluation.
   - State determines behavior, context feeding, and LLM prompting.
   - Scratchpad reasoning is optionally exposed.

4. **LLM Reasoning Layer** (Optional)
   - Selectively invoked to reason inside scratchpad or generate user-facing responses.
   - Can propose transitions, but final authority is always with FSA rules.

5. **Output Handler**
   - Formats final response (e.g., synthesized speech).
   - Sends back audio stream to caller.

## Advantages of OpusAgent

- **Ultra-Low Latency:** FastAPI and direct WebSocket handling minimize delays.
- **Full State Awareness:** Every response is conditioned on an explicit state.
- **Dynamic but Safe:** Agent "thinks" inside scratchpads without risking control loss.
- **Highly Modular:** States, transitions, and reasoning policies are easily extendable.
- **Transparent Reasoning:** Scratchpad outputs are optionally logged for analysis and audit.

## Use Cases

- Banking: Secure, real-time account inquiries and transfers.
- Healthcare: Patient appointment scheduling and triage.
- Retail: Intelligent order management and support.
- Enterprise: Internal hotline assistants with compliance-driven behavior.

## Future Work

- **Multi-Agent Escalation:** Seamless handoff between FSA agents based on intent.
- **Adaptive State Evolution:** Allow FSA to evolve over session lifetime using reinforcement learning.
- **Cross-Channel Continuity:** Persist user FSA across voice, SMS, and chat interfaces.

## Conclusion

OpusAgent represents a new approach to real-time voice agent development: combining the speed and modularity of FastAPI, the rigor of finite-state control, and the intelligence of reasoning-capable agents. With Finite State Agents (FSA), OpusAgent provides a foundation for scalable, safe, and satisfying conversational experiences in telephony environments.
